```

```

### Utilisation

Store **all the tasks** you want to **execute in a pipeline**, set the mode and execute it
Each part of Scouter has their own tasks, some are removed or added beside the others

> [!NOTE]
> Syntax is important, get_ function will create a variable in memory that will be usable, add_ will an in the memory, delete_ will delete, and add_mass_ won't pass a reference to avoid memory surcharge

**Every functions** return an **Error Code**, and the **corresponding result** to log every steps.

> [!TIP]
> Every Function is fully customisable, to use an argument from another function, just add it in the header of the function.
